Caesar Cipher Encryption & Decryption Using Python
🔐 Overview
The Caesar Cipher Project is a Python-based application that enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages using a shift-based substitution cipher. Designed to demonstrate fundamental cryptographic principles, this project serves as an excellent introduction to encryption techniques. It provides a user-friendly command-line interface (CLI) where users can input a message, specify a shift value, and choose between encryption or decryption. The tool ensures that uppercase and lowercase letters are handled separately while preserving non-alphabetic characters such as numbers and punctuation.

🔹 Features
✅ Encrypt and decrypt text with a custom shift value.
✅ Handles uppercase and lowercase letters separately.
✅ Maintains non-alphabetic characters (e.g., numbers, punctuation).
✅ User-friendly CLI menu with input validation and error handling.

🔹 How It Works
The Caesar Cipher works by shifting each letter in the input text forward (encryption) or backward (decryption) by a specified number of positions in the alphabet.
Encryption: Each letter is shifted forward based on the input shift value.
Decryption: Each letter is shifted backward to restore the original message.
Character Handling: Non-alphabetic characters remain unaltered, ensuring the integrity of numbers, punctuation, and spaces.

🔹 Cybersecurity Significance
Understanding encryption fundamentals is critical in data security. The Caesar Cipher, while simple, serves as an essential introduction to cryptographic techniques and secure communication. It lays the groundwork for modern encryption algorithms such as AES, RSA, and DES, which are widely used in real-world cybersecurity applications.
